project process i followed:-
-------------------------
Collected and analyzed rainfall data from Kaggle, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and trends.
Handled outliers and missing values to ensure data quality, applying appropriate imputation and transformation techniques.
Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance and improve predictive accuracy.
Applied classification model including Logistic Regression,hypertuning techinque, achieving 85% accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, and cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and machine learning model implementation.
Visualized key insights and model results using Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective communication.
